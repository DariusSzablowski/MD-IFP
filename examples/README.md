#  This is a collection of example recipes showing how to carry out particular tasks using MD-IFP scripts


## 1. Generation of the Interaction Fingerprint table for a set of MD trajectories obtained either from standard MD simulations or RAMD simulations and saving IFPs in a pkl file
    IFP.py
## 2. Visualization  of computed IFPs (from pkl file with IFPs)
    IFP_contacts_quickView.py
## 3. Generation of the Interaction Fingerprint table for a set of MD trajectories obtained  from RAMD simulations (Gromacs) of a membrane protein and saving IFPs in a pkl file. In this example ligand- membrane contacts are counted.
