__MD-IFP__


version 1.0   (Kokh et al. JCP 2020) 
version 1.1
   patches:
     1. procedure for detection of aromatic interactions revised (several bugs fixed):
      - CG* aromatic atoms missed 
      - cation-aromatic and aromatic-aromatic were mixed out
      - prot.-ligand and ligand - protein dist. 5.5 A
      - ligand S - aromatic residue interaction removed
      - in adding contacts thet were not counted - (< 4) updated to (<= 4)
   added JN for testing IF on 40 PDB complexes
